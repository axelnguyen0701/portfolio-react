# Axel's Portfolio 😎 [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/925c5301-6b7e-475c-806f-488e94e4f094/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/axelportfolio/deploys)
## ❓ I've always wanted to make a CMS to serve my portfolio instead of a static HTML one. However, the thought of creating a new nodejs server still haunts me so I decided to go with firebase. And I'm hooked. Firebase is amazing. I set this up on my weekend and it runs like how I wanted.
## 💥 Features:
  - 🎉 CRUD operations (when authorized) 
  - 🔐 Authorization and authentication via google (thanks firebase auth 😝)
  - 🏞️ Image uploading (thanks firebase storage 💿)
## ✅ Testing (who would have thought?)
  - You can run the test with `npm test`
  - I wanted to make sure that all firestore operations are running well so I wrote some test (how thoughtful 😤)
